# IBM-datascience-capstone-project
This repository contains all code, notebooks, and supporting files developed for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project. The project focuses on predicting the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings, a key factor in SpaceX’s cost advantage through rocket reusability.

The repository includes:

- Data Collection: Scripts for retrieving launch data from the SpaceX API and supplementing it with Wikipedia data via web scraping.

- Data Wrangling: Code for merging datasets, handling missing values, and creating the target variable.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations and SQL queries to uncover patterns in payload, orbit type, and success rates.

- Interactive Analytics: Folium maps and Plotly Dash dashboards for geographic and operational insights.

- Predictive Modeling: Classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree and KNN) with hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.

This work demonstrates how data-driven insights and predictive analytics can support cost estimation and competitive bidding strategies in the aerospace industry.
